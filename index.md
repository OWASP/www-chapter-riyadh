<b>OWASP Top 10 API Security</b> <br/>

Open Discussion on Top 10 API Security, Coffee and Snacks.<br/>


<b>Open Discussion Description</b><br/>
A foundational element of innovation in today’s app-driven world is the API. From banks, retail and transportation to IoT, autonomous vehicles and smart cities, APIs are a critical part of modern mobile, SaaS and web applications and can be found in customer-facing, partner-facing and internal applications. By nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and because of this have increasingly become a target for attackers. Without secure APIs, rapid innovation would be impossible.

API Security focuses on strategies and solutions to understand and mitigate the unique vulnerabilities and security risks of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). <br/> <br/>

Time - 8:00 PM <br />

<b>What are we missing in Web Applications?</b> <br/>

In today's world, we have a modern and stable web application framework to develop on. That is already so much secured from the attacks, regardless of the OS. If you design the system properly, attacker cannot injection the system. Or attacker cannot attack the website with common attacks like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, SSTI, etc. On the other hand, we have sophisticated scanners which scan the website dynamically with the interactive logins as well, it scans the website along with the internal pages. And we have secure coding practices as well along with the scanners which can scan the source code regardless of the programming language. They are necessary tools while developing a secure application.

But what all these are missing is "Business Logic Flaws", which are the reason for the highest-paid bounties on Hackerone, bugcrowd, etc. Business Logic Flaws are the attacks, which neither the source-code analysis tool nor dynamic web application scanner can detect.

The presentation/talk will discuss vulnerabilities that can arise from business logic flaws which can affect confidentiality, integrity & availability of customers' information as well as the product that is connected with the application. We will discuss CVE-2019-2823 - Oracle Financial Services along with other 2FA bypasses in Financial Mobile Applications. Where I was able to do vertical privilege escalation in regards to roles, checker, maker, etc. modules. These were critical findings that were used in financial information systems. On which APTs are attacking day and night.

The majority of the banks use this Oracle service in the world. There are a lot of similar bugs in the world right now as well, in regards to Business Logic Flaws. We have to enhance the testing skills rather than depending on the scanners, manual testing approach to test the use cases will be a good approach.

Briefing Outline:  <br />
~ What are current/critical Web Application Flaws?  <br />
~ What are Business Logic Flaws (BLF)?  <br />
~ Common Vulnerabilities in with BLF.  <br />
~ Security Design Flaws.  <br />
~ Me against the Odds – Scavenging the application.  <br />
~ Bottlenecks, Solution.  <br />
~ Pwning the financial application.  <br />
~ 2FA bypass with BLF.  <br />
~ Test Cases for your application.  <br />
~ Closing Remarks / Q&As  <br />

Takeaways:  <br />
~ Test Business Logic in Web Application.  <br />
~ Different methodologies to test against this issue.  <br />
~ What to look for in source code to mitigate it.

<b>The Challenges and Opportunities in TLS1.3 Monitoring</b> <br/>
 

Ensuring users' privacy while protecting your network is becoming a hard tasks with the adoption of new features in TLS1.3 such as the encrypted TLS server name indication (ESNI) in addition to other protocols such as the encrypted DNS such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH). TLS 1.3 is a great development in the secure transmission of data. But there’s a few security challenges that we need to be ready for. In this talk, I will present the current threat landscape and possible mitigation to some of the known malicious usages of the new privacy features implemented in TLS1.3. We will discuss the impact of TLS 1.3 on Network-based security solutions used by enterprises and public sector given that the several changes introduced in TLS 1.3 have a good goal to improve the overall security and privacy provided. However, some of these changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions <br/>

<b>Talk #1</b> <br />
Date - 26th September 2020 <br />
Time - 4:15 PM <br />

<b>DevSecOps:Separating Myth from reality</b> <br />
When you think about DevSecOps or DevOps, you probably think of tooling. A tool in every stage of secure SDLC, scanning on each commit. A few hundred to few thousand scans to gather all the issues for a project or maybe vulnerability management.Yet DevSecOps has completely changed the way we think of security. New ways of scaling information security mean that traditional security mechanisms like pentesting are no longer holy grails to secure organizations.More and more, organizations are working towards building security inside out rather than bolting it at the end, and security engineers are starting to see the benefits of this new type of security.But as more companies begin to embrace DevSecOps, both organizations and security managers have discovered that DevSecOps has its own complexities. These days there's more folklore than the science behind DevSecOps in organizations, more myths than reality.Yet with the right attitude and a few simple ground rules, companies can benefit significantly from DevSecOps.<br/>
In this talk, you'll also learn:<br/>
1. How organizations can bust DevSecOps myths and concentrate on reality.<br/>
2. Why it's a good idea to think DevSecOps program from the organization's point of view.<br/>
3. Why organizations need to streamline DevSecOps by concentrating on People, Process, and Technology.<br/><br/>

<b>Zero Trusting Your Enterprise - A Deep Dive Technical Implementation Guide.</b> <br />
Traditional IT network security is based on the castle concept. In castle security, it is hard to obtain access from outside the network, but everyone inside the network is trusted by default.
Zero trust security is an IT security model that requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access resources on a network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.
Zero trust s a holistic approach to network security that incorporates several different principles and implementations. We will discuss the best recommended ways to start implementing the zero trust concept in your enterprise.
