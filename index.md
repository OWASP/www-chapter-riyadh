<b>Zero Trusting Your Enterprise - A Deep Dive Technical Implementation Guide.</b> <br />
Traditional IT network security is based on the castle concept. In castle security, it is hard to obtain access from outside the network, but everyone inside the network is trusted by default.
Zero trust security is an IT security model that requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access resources on a network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.
Zero trust s a holistic approach to network security that incorporates several different principles and implementations. We will discuss the best recommended ways to start implementing the zero trust concept in your enterprise.
